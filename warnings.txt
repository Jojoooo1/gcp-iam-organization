gcloud SDK:
  - PERMISSION_DENIED can be thrown when trying to delete resources that do not exist

Hierarchy
  - Create a hierarchy that closely matches your organization’s corporate structure
  - Use Organization Policy Service to get centralized and programmatic control over your organization's cloud resources (For example, you can define a constraint to restrict virtual machine instances from having an external IP address.)
  - Use groups in preference to explicitly listing large numbers of users. Not only does it scale better, 
    it also provides a very efficient way to update the access control for a large number of objects all at once.
  - Any GCP resources that you allocate and use must belong to a project.


Compute (enable compute.googleapis.com):
  When you first enable the Google Compute Engine, ** it automatically creates a “Default Service Account.” **
  If you don’t make any custom changes while launching a new virtual machine, it will automatically use the default service account. 
  This means that your virtual machine will authenticate as the service account, so it can make any GCP API calls as that service account. 
  If a user were to SSH into the virtual machine and start running “gcloud” commands, it would utilize those service account credentials to interact with GCP.

  ** Google recommends that you immediately remove the default service account. **

VPC:
  - By default, all VMs in GCP are assigned a public IP address and are therefore accessible directly from the internet if there are firewall rules that allows it 
    (such as the default ones). This is a risk that could be easily mitigated by disabling public IPs in a project. Instead use a NAT
  - Deny management access (SSH/RDP) directly from the internet and instead use a VPN solution or a bastion host

Project Networking:
  - By default when you create a new project in GCP ** it generates a default network and associated firewall rules. **

Compute Engine Networking:
  - It is recommended to disable project-wide SSH keys as it applies a coarse security model that allows the holder of an added SSH key privileged access to all Linux instances.
  - Default service account that each VM obtains at creation, unless configured differently. The default service account gives read-only 
    access to all Cloud Storage buckets and its content that resides in the same project as the VM instance. The implication of this is that 
    if no extra configuration is made, an attacker who gains access to a VM will also be able to access the information stored in the cloud storage buckets.

Logging:
  - Enable the VPC flow log at full sampling rate to detect port scans or anomalous behavior.
