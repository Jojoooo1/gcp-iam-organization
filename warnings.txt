## General ##
Org administrator: Can grant any role in the org
Billing account: 
  - Only use 1 primary billing account except if you are different entity. 
  - Labels everything to make your billing smart

Hierarchy
  - Create a hierarchy that closely matches your organization’s corporate structure
  - Use Organization Policy Service to get centralized and programmatic control over your organization's cloud resources (For example, you can define a constraint to restrict virtual machine instances from having an external IP address.)
  - Use groups in preference to explicitly listing large numbers of users.
  => provides a very efficient way to update the access control for a large number of users at once.
  - Any GCP resources that you allocate must belong to a project.


Compute (enable compute.googleapis.com):
  When you enable Google Compute Engine on a project it will ** creates a Compute Engine default service account **  (Editor role (roles/editor) on the project)
  => This service account will be inherited/used directly by the resources below the project
  => Enabled by default on all instances created by the gcloud command-line tool and the Cloud Console
  ** Google recommends that you immediately remove the default service account. **
  (same with App Engine)
  
## Networking ##
VPC:
  - By default, all VMs in GCP are assigned a public IP address and are therefore accessible directly from the internet if there are firewall rules that allows it 
    (such as the default ones). This is a risk that could be easily mitigated by disabling public IPs in a project. Instead use a NAT
  - Deny management access (SSH/RDP) directly from the internet and instead use a VPN solution or a bastion host
Project:
  - By default when you create a new project in GCP ** it generates a default network and associated firewall rules. **
Compute Engine:
  - It is recommended to disable project-wide SSH keys as it applies a coarse security model that allows the holder of an added SSH key privileged access to all Linux instances.
  - Default service account that each VM obtains at creation, unless configured differently. The default service account gives read-only 
    access to all Cloud Storage buckets and its content that resides in the same project as the VM instance. The implication of this is that 
    if no extra configuration is made, an attacker who gains access to a VM will also be able to access the information stored in the cloud storage buckets.
Logging:
  - Enable the VPC flow log at full sampling rate to detect port scans or anomalous behavior.

## Additional Informations ##
gcloud SDK:
  - PERMISSION_DENIED can be thrown when trying to delete resources that do not exist
